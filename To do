Urgent
	Fix scraping issue - crimedata.com found as available
	Fix threading / socketio issue - why doesn't it send messages after the first?
	Allow domain masking while also allowing refresh of same page (need /queue/...)
	Fix slow widening to the right during loading issue
	memory issue
		see how much memory I have
		see how much memory a browser uses / where I'm using it
		queue users in case I get many requests
	check user input and validate before they can submit
	have page refresh when result is found: long-polling, web-sockets, server-sent events, an AJAX request every N seconds
		make animation while getting results

Medium urgent
	make it stop when someone hits back
	compute and flash estimated wait time based on # of domains
	display 'sorry error' text for urls that didn't work, also keep track of them
	Remove processes aborted in the middle (esp Phatomjs) - check what Flask does
	use threads within users if have enough memory
	disable unnecessary javascript files in selenium

Small issues
	Unique id (UUID postgres) for user id
	make example page for keywords
	make a funny error page
	estimate time / say how long it usually takes for X number of domains
	check that they can alter URL and it still works?
	add godaddy link to csv (rather than 'N/A')
	change url that appears in browser
